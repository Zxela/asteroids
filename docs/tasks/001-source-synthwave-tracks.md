# 001: Source Synthwave Tracks

## Objective

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Find menu track: relaxed, atmospheric synthwave (chill energy)

- [ ] Find boss track: intense, climactic synthwave (high energy)
- [ ] All tracks are royalty-free for game distribution
- [ ] All tracks are MP3 format, <3MB each
- [ ] Tracks share recognizable synthwave characteristics
- [ ] Document download URLs for user to retrieve
